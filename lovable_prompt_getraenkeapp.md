# Perfect Lovable Prompt for GetränkeApp Modern UI Redesign

## Project Overview
Transform the GetränkeApp (Beverage Booking Club App) from a functional Java Android tablet application into a modern, beautifully designed web application with exceptional UI/UX. The current system is a local-first beverage tracking solution for a 20-member club running on a Lenovo TabTB311FU tablet.

## GitHub Integration Setup
- **Repository**: https://github.com/mrbell2811/GetraenkeApp-Java
- **Connect to existing repo**: The current Java implementation provides complete business logic reference
- **Branch strategy**: Use main branch for Lovable development, sync changes bidirectionally
- **Code context**: All existing entities, database schema, and UI patterns available for reference

## Current System Context (Reference for Business Logic)

### Core Workflow (Must Maintain)
1. **Main Screen**: Grid of member name buttons (20 members, configurable layout)
2. **Beverage Selection**: Full-screen grid with drink names and prices
3. **Quantity Confirmation**: Default 1, +/- buttons, total calculation
4. **Booking Confirmation**: 1-second popup, auto-return to main screen

### Data Models (Transform to Web/React)
```typescript
// Current Java entities to transform:
interface Member {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}

interface Beverage {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  category: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}

interface Transaction {
  id: number;
  memberId: number;
  beverageId: number;
  quantity: number;
  timestamp: Date;
  totalAmount: number;
}
```

### Technical Requirements Translation
- **From**: Local SQLite + Java Android → **To**: Modern React + Local Storage/IndexedDB
- **From**: Always-on tablet display → **To**: Progressive Web App (PWA) with kiosk mode
